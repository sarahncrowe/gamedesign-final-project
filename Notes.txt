> Created first Game Sprite
	> Got the right blend of cute & creepy
	> Allowed for some pixel art practice
	
> Game Maker tutorial
	> More comfortable with making a game
	> Familiar with sprites, rooms, objects, sounds, ect.
	> Still much to learn. Next: scripting
	

2 FEBRUARY 2014

> Created background for the room
	> Sprite for the boy was too small compared to the room
	> Problems with scaling (sprites are all power 2)
	> Will resize room to fit boy properly

> Creation of music track
	> Not expecting this to be final music for the game
	> Allows for modification to more sombre/dark tracks w/ same theme
	> Allowed me (Matt) to get back into recording

4 FEBRUARY 2014

> "Differential pixel" sprites
	>Synced to Art Assets branch
	> Tried to make the art designs look more like traditional sprites rather than MS Paint art.
	> Proof of concept is solid.
	> Changed boy sprite from 32x32 to 64x64. This allowed for thinner borderline and more detail
	> Next: lighting. Made a shadow sprite, will play with light more.
	
17 FEBRUARY 2014

> Woo long break. It's been a little while.
	> I truly wish I could work on this all time instead of doing Assembly all the time.
	
> Started actually adding assets to the project.
	> Wondering if we should scale the sprites again
	> May not be working with the most recent sprites
		> They seem different from last I saw
		> No matter, that's not really important at the moment.
	
> Researched dialogues and how to add them to the game.
	> At the moment, I'm going with a separate box at the bottom for dialogue
	> Thinking about doing a pop-up over the room, but I don't think there's enough space
	> So many Youtube tutorials and forums that end up helping nothing. Ugh.
	> A few that helped! Yay!
