23 JANUARY 2014

> Created first Game Sprite
	> Got the right blend of cute & creepy
	> Allowed for some pixel art practice
	
> Game Maker tutorial
	> More comfortable with making a game
	> Familiar with sprites, rooms, objects, sounds, ect.
	> Still much to learn. Next: scripting
	

2 FEBRUARY 2014

> Created background for the room
	> Sprite for the boy was too small compared to the room
	> Problems with scaling (sprites are all power 2)
	> Will resize room to fit boy properly

> Creation of music track
	> Not expecting this to be final music for the game
	> Allows for modification to more sombre/dark tracks w/ same theme
	> Allowed me (Matt) to get back into recording

	
4 FEBRUARY 2014

> "Differential pixel" sprites
	>Synced to Art Assets branch
	> Tried to make the art designs look more like traditional sprites rather than MS Paint art.
	> Proof of concept is solid.
	> Changed boy sprite from 32x32 to 64x64. This allowed for thinner borderline and more detail
	> Next: lighting. Made a shadow sprite, will play with light more.
	
	
17 FEBRUARY 2014

> Woo long break. It's been a little while.
	> I truly wish I could work on this all time instead of doing Assembly all the time.
	
> Started actually adding assets to the project.
	> Wondering if we should scale the sprites again
	> May not be working with the most recent sprites
		> They seem different from last I saw
		> No matter, that's not really important at the moment.
		> I assume this is either due to not being committed or my inexperience with git.
	
> Researched dialogues and how to add them to the game.
	> At the moment, I'm going with a separate box at the bottom for dialogue
	> Thinking about doing a pop-up over the room, but I don't think there's enough space
	> So many Youtube tutorials and forums that end up helping nothing. Ugh.
	> A few that helped! Yay!
	
	
20 FEBRUARY 2014

> Found a dialogue engine that does exactly what I need to do
	> I have no idea how to use it.
	> Not sure if I'm wasting time by trying to figure it out
	> update: yes, I was wasting time. free version restrictions. see below.

> Ended up choosing a simpler engine that was easier to decipher.
	> Game Maker Language is not easily mastered in mere hours.
	> The free version does not have the same resources as paid versions
		> Means I can't just pick any engine off the internet and simply throw it into the game
		> Resources include some functions that provide greater efficiency/usability/ect.
	> I'm seriously struggling with this though.
		> The initial tutorials were pretty easy, but I think they're user written
			> Writing style seems different for each and instructions aren't 100% consistent.
		> Beginning to doubt that this is going to come together
			> Of course, I say that past my bedtime and after I've been working on it (read: frustrated) most of the day
			> I'm sure going to bed will provide some much needed perspective

> Have the dialogue of the first scene coded.
	> I'm not entirely sure that I'm using the best method, but it's all I know how to do right now
	> As far as I can tell, not going completely in the wrong direction. Just a little misguided.

> Next is to fix the room (not using a view) and add in player dialogue choices.

> My game maker folder is really messy with all the engines and tutorials I downloaded
	> Have to clean it up, just don't want to delete something that might be important.
	
SOMETIME AFTER DEMO FEBRUARY 2014
> Got the user input to work
> Doing "advanced" things as a game maker beginner sucks.
	
17 MARCH 2014

> Decided to switch to Java.
