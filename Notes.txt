> Created first Game Sprite
	> Got the right blend of cute & creepy
	> Allowed for some pixel art practice
	
> Game Maker tutorial
	> More comfortable with making a game
	> Familiar with sprites, rooms, objects, sounds, ect.
	> Still much to learn. Next: scripting
	

2 FEBRUARY 2014

> Created background for the room
	> Sprite for the boy was too small compared to the room
	> Problems with scaling (sprites are all power 2)
	> Will resize room to fit boy properly

> Creation of music track
	> Not expecting this to be final music for the game
	> Allows for modification to more sombre/dark tracks w/ same theme
	> Allowed me (Matt) to get back into recording

4 FEBRUARY 2014

> "Differential pixel" sprites
	>Synced to Art Assets branch
	> Tried to make the art designs look more like traditional sprites rather than MS Paint art.
	> Proof of concept is solid.
	> Changed boy sprite from 32x32 to 64x64. This allowed for thinner borderline and more detail
	> Next: lighting. Made a shawdow sprite, will play with light more.
